[Note This is not legal advice!!! - see disclaimer, you must consult your lawyers, I’m not admitted in the U.S.] 
[Note: As you know, you CAN’T grant authorization in the name of third parties or entities (for out-of-scope testing) without their permission and consent. If the hunter finds a bug on a third-party component, sharing the report with such a third-party without any legal assurances (just good faith) on whether *they* will pursue legal action against the hunter is not very nice on your behalf. Consider a commitment to attempt to gain such authorization prior to sharing. Other legal issues may arise here as well (such as copyright license in the report).]  

We will not share your report with a third-party without gaining their commitment they will not pursue legal action against you or refer you the public inquiry. Please note again that we can’t authorize out-of-scope testing in the name of third parties and such testing is beyond the scope of the program.
