[VIP Note]: You must consult with a lawyer before implementing any language!!! 

[Note]: The below safe harbor language is based on my general academic research in this field, the DOJ guidelines on this issue (which you must read! - https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips/page/file/983996/download) and some leading policies like Dropbox.  

[For third-party issues - check out other topics] 

Level 1: Explicit safe harbor [with good faith violations]

To encourage responsible disclosures, we will not pursue civil action or initiate a complaint to law enforcement for accidental, good faith violations of this policy. We consider security research and vulnerability disclosure activities conducted consistent with this policy to constitute “authorized” conduct under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the DMCA and applicable anti-hacking laws such as Cal. Penal Code 502(c). We waive any DMCA claim against you for circumventing the technological measures we have used to protect the applications in scope.

If legal action is initiated by a third party against you and you have complied with this bug bounty policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.

Please understand that if your security research involves the networks, systems, information, applications, products, or services of another party (which is not us), that third party may determine whether to pursue legal action. We cannot and do not authorize security research in the name of other entities.

You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws. 

Please submit a report to us before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent with or unaddressed by this policy.
